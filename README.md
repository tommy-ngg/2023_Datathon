Summary:

States are generally increasing in their investments in renewable energy. The country as a whole is getting more green. But, there are some states that are doing it faster and are proportionally more eco-friendly than others.

We began the project examining the data and processing it to find any obvious trends. We believe that data creates results and found more data from outside sources to supplement our findings. This improved our results and let us examine the trends over a larger time period.

Furthermore, we created graphs to examine trends of our original data, as well as additional features. This let us draw clearer conclusions that may have been hard to see from numbers alone.
